### About EMS Framework

Welcome to The `EMS PROJECT`, This is a backend servive api, was written in efficient, modular for a better responsiveness.

These are the main features and principles has been built:

- [x] **Highly performant** : depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 30 thousand requests per second.
- [x] **Extensible** : this is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins and decorators.
- [x] **Schema based** : even if it is not mandatory we recommend to use JSON Schema to validate but the routes and serialize outputs, internally compiles the schema in a highly performant function.
- [x] **Logging** : logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best logger to almost remove this cost, Great!
